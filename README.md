# URL-Shortener-Microservice
A Flask-based microservice that shortens URLs using base62 encoding and stores them in SQLite. Generates redirectable short links that point back to the original URLs.
This microservice web application converts long URLs into short redirectable links using base62 encoding. It is developed using Flask for the web interface and SQLite for persistent storage. When users visit the short link, the app redirects them to the original URL.
